# Download Progress Fix

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Progress Bar Not Visible for Large Downloads
**Issue:** When downloading large models, the progress bar would complete its simulated animation (6 seconds) before the actual download finished, making it disappear while the download was still in progress.

**Root Cause:** The frontend was using a simulated progress animation instead of listening to real-time progress updates from the backend.

**Solution:** Implemented real-time progress tracking using SignalR events.

### Problem 2: Download Button Not Re-enabling After Completion
**Issue:** After a large download completed, the "Download from URL" button remained disabled.

**Root Cause:** The `downloadFromUrl()` method was resetting `isDownloading = false` immediately after calling `downloadModel()`, but for large downloads, the actual completion happened much later via SignalR events. The button state wasn't being updated when the real completion event arrived.

**Solution:** Changed the flow to only reset `isDownloading` when the `ModelPullCompleted` SignalR event is received.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Real-Time Progress Updates

**Before:**
```typescript
// Used simulated progress with fixed 6-second animation
simulateDownloadProgress(progress);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Listen to real-time SignalR events
this.modelService.modelEvents$.subscribe(event => {
  if (event.type === 'ModelPullProgress') {
    // Update progress bar with real data from backend
    const statusData = JSON.parse(status);
    const percentage = (statusData.completed / statusData.total) * 100;
    progress.progress = percentage;
  }
});
```

### 2. Proper Button State Management

**Before:**
```typescript
async downloadFromUrl() {
  this.isDownloading = true;
  await this.downloadModel(modelName);
  this.isDownloading = false;  // ‚ùå Resets immediately
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
async downloadFromUrl() {
  this.isDownloading = true;
  await this.downloadModel(modelName);
  // ‚úÖ Don't reset here - wait for ModelPullCompleted event
}

// In ModelPullCompleted handler:
if (this.currentDownloadModel === modelName) {
  this.isDownloading = false;  // ‚úÖ Reset when actually complete
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Progress Display

**Added:**
- Model name display
- Percentage indicator
- Status message from backend
- Better visual feedback

**Template:**
```html
<div class="progress-header">
  <span class="progress-model-name">{{ progress.modelName }}</span>
  <span class="progress-percentage">{{ progress.progress }}%</span>
</div>
<div class="progress-bar">
  <div class="progress-fill" [style.width.%]="progress.progress"></div>
</div>
<div class="progress-message">{{ progress.message }}</div>
```

### 4. Removed Simulated Progress

**Deleted:** `simulateDownloadProgress()` method - no longer needed since we use real progress.

### 5. Duplicate Download Prevention

**Added:**
```typescript
// Check if already downloading
if (this.downloadProgress.some(p => p.modelName === modelName && p.status === 'downloading')) {
  console.log(`Model ${modelName} is already downloading`);
  return;
}
```

## üîÑ SignalR Events Used

### ModelPullProgress
Sent continuously during download with status updates:
```json
{
  "modelName": "gemma3:27b",
  "status": "{\"status\":\"downloading\",\"completed\":1234567,\"total\":12345678}",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T..."
}
```

### ModelPullCompleted
Sent when download finishes (success or failure):
```json
{
  "modelName": "gemma3:27b",
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T...",
  "updatedModels": [...]
}
```

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### Before:
1. ‚ùå Progress bar shows for 6 seconds then disappears
2. ‚ùå Large downloads continue invisibly in background
3. ‚ùå Button stays disabled after download completes
4. ‚ùå No real progress information
5. ‚ùå User doesn't know if download is still running

### After:
1. ‚úÖ Progress bar shows for entire download duration
2. ‚úÖ Real-time progress updates (0-100%)
3. ‚úÖ Button re-enables 2 seconds after completion
4. ‚úÖ Shows actual status messages from Ollama
5. ‚úÖ Clear visual feedback throughout process
6. ‚úÖ Progress bar auto-hides after completion
7. ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate downloads

## üß™ Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Start the application:**
   ```powershell
   cd src/CodeMentorAI.API
   dotnet run
   
   # In another terminal:
   cd src/CodeMentorAI.Web
   ng serve
   ```

2. **Test with large model:**
   - Navigate to Model Download page
   - Paste URL: `https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:27b`
   - Click "Download from URL"
   - **Expected:** Progress bar shows real progress, button stays disabled
   - **Expected:** After completion, progress bar shows "100%" for 2 seconds
   - **Expected:** Button re-enables after progress bar disappears

3. **Test with small model:**
   - Try downloading a smaller model like `llama2:7b`
   - **Expected:** Same behavior but faster

4. **Test duplicate prevention:**
   - Start downloading a model
   - Try downloading the same model again
   - **Expected:** Second download is prevented (check console)

## üìù Files Modified

- `src/CodeMentorAI.Web/src/app/components/model-download/model-download.component.ts`
  - Updated constructor to listen to `ModelPullProgress` events
  - Modified `downloadModel()` to remove simulation
  - Updated `downloadFromUrl()` to not reset flags immediately
  - Removed `simulateDownloadProgress()` method
  - Enhanced progress bar template with name, percentage, and message
  - Added CSS for new progress elements

## üöÄ Deployment

Changes are automatically deployed when you:
1. Refresh the browser (Angular hot reload)
2. Or restart the frontend: `ng serve`

No backend changes required - the backend was already sending the correct events!

## üìä Technical Details

### Backend (Already Working)
The backend was already sending real-time progress via:
- `ModelsController.PullModel()` - Creates Progress<string> reporter
- `OllamaService.PullModelAsync()` - Streams progress from Ollama API
- SignalR Hub - Broadcasts `ModelPullProgress` events to all clients

### Frontend (Fixed)
- Now properly subscribes to `ModelPullProgress` events
- Parses JSON status data to extract progress percentage
- Updates UI in real-time as events arrive
- Manages button state based on actual completion events

## üéâ Result

Users now get accurate, real-time feedback during model downloads, and the UI properly reflects the download state at all times!
