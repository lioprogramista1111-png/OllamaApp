# üöÄ How to Push to GitHub - Simple Guide

Follow these steps to publish your CodeMentorAI project to GitHub.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open your browser
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create New Repository:**
   - Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner
   - Click **New repository**

3. **Fill in Repository Details:**
   - **Repository name:** `CodeMentorAI`
   - **Description:** `Intelligent Code Assistant with Ollama integration`
   - **Public or Private:** Choose what you prefer
   - **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check these boxes:
     - ‚ùå Add a README file
     - ‚ùå Add .gitignore
     - ‚ùå Choose a license
   - Click **Create repository**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with commands. You'll see a URL like:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeMentorAI.git
```

**Copy this URL!** You'll need it in the next step.

## Step 3: Connect Your Local Project to GitHub

Open PowerShell in your project folder and run these commands:

### Option A: Using PowerShell (Recommended)

```powershell
# Navigate to your project (if not already there)
cd C:\Users\liopr\Desktop\Test111\OllamaApp

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeMentorAI.git

# Verify it was added
git remote -v

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Copy-Paste Commands

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username, then copy and paste these commands one by one:**

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeMentorAI.git
```

```powershell
git branch -M main
```

```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Enter Your Credentials

When you run `git push`, you'll be asked for credentials:

### If Using HTTPS (Recommended for Beginners):

1. **Username:** Enter your GitHub username
2. **Password:** You need a **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

#### How to Create a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Click your profile picture ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Scroll down and click **Developer settings** (bottom left)
3. Click **Personal access tokens** ‚Üí **Tokens (classic)**
4. Click **Generate new token** ‚Üí **Generate new token (classic)**
5. Give it a name: `CodeMentorAI`
6. Set expiration: Choose your preference (e.g., 90 days or No expiration)
7. Select scopes: Check **repo** (this gives full control of repositories)
8. Click **Generate token** at the bottom
9. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)
10. Use this token as your password when pushing

## Step 5: Verify Upload

1. Go back to your GitHub repository page
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. You should see all your files!

## üéâ Success!

Your project is now on GitHub! You can share it with:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeMentorAI
```

## üìù Quick Reference

### Complete Command Sequence

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\liopr\Desktop\Test111\OllamaApp

# 2. Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeMentorAI.git

# 3. Rename branch
git branch -M main

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Future Updates

After the initial push, when you make changes:

```powershell
# 1. Add changes
git add .

# 2. Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "remote origin already exists"

If you see this error, remove the old remote first:

```powershell
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeMentorAI.git
```

### "Authentication failed"

- Make sure you're using a **Personal Access Token**, not your password
- Generate a new token if needed (see Step 4 above)

### "Permission denied"

- Check that you're logged into the correct GitHub account
- Verify the repository URL is correct
- Make sure you have permission to push to the repository

### "Updates were rejected"

If someone else pushed changes, pull first:

```powershell
git pull origin main --rebase
git push
```

## üîê Saving Credentials (Optional)

To avoid entering credentials every time:

### Windows Credential Manager

```powershell
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

Next time you push, Windows will save your credentials.

### Git Credential Manager

Git for Windows includes Credential Manager. It should prompt you once and remember.

## üìñ What Happens When You Push?

1. ‚úÖ Git uploads all your files to GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Your commit history is preserved
3. ‚úÖ README.md will display on the repository page
4. ‚úÖ Others can clone, fork, and contribute
5. ‚úÖ You can access your code from anywhere
